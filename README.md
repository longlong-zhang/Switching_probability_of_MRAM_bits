# Switching probability of all perpendicular spin valve nanopillars
The notebook in this repository shows how to obtain the switching probability and related error rates for perpendicular Magnetic Tunnel Junctions (pMTJs)-- the devices used to build modern MRAM. Full details in: https://doi.org/10.1063/1.5003832


Three examples of applying the formulas in this paper are shown in the figure below (Figure 2 in the paper):

(a) The Read Error Rate for a 100ns pulse is shown from the present theory and from an approximate expression found in the literature.

(b) The Write Error Rate is shown as a function of the normalized current for pulse-lengths from 5ns to 100ns (&#964; from 2.5 to 50).

(c) The spin current required to achieve a specific Write Error Rate target is shown as a function of the pulse-length.
